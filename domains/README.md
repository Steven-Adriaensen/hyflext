Provides the resources for all 3 domains extending the HyFlex benchmark set:
- kp: 0-1 Knapsack Problem
- qap: Quadratic Assignment Problem
- mac: Max Cut Problem

For each of these domains a jar file is provided, containing their respective binaries, as well as a brief description of the problem domain and heuristic set.

- hyflex_ext.jar, a jar file packaging all 3 domains.


**To use the domains**:

1. add one of the jar files to the classpath of your project, 
alongside with the original chesc.jar (containing HyFlex itself), 
which can be found at [http://www.asap.cs.nott.ac.uk/external/chesc2011/](http://www.asap.cs.nott.ac.uk/external/chesc2011/)
2. In your code, create an instance of the desired ProblemDomain class:
- kp: KnapsackProblem.class 
- qap: QAP.class 
- mac: MaxCut.class 
3. Use this instance, as you would use any of the 6 original HyFlex domains.

If you do use any of these resources for your research, we kindly ask you to acknowledge this, by citing the following article:
